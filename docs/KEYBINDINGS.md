# Keybindings

Every shortcut in the app. **Source of truth is the command table**
(`Sources/ReaderUI/Commands/CommandRegistry.swift`) — the menu bar, the
command palette (⌘⇧P), and the help overlay ("/" or "?") all render from it,
and this document mirrors it. If you change a binding, change the table;
update this file in the same commit. `CommandRegistryTests` enforces unique
ids and no duplicate chords. Users can override any of it with a
keybindings.json overlay — see "User keybindings" below.

Conventions borrowed from VS Code (palettes, quick-open), Safari/Chrome
(tabs, history), Preview (go to page, layout), and Gmail/GitHub ("?" help).

## File

| Shortcut | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⌘N | New Window | |
| ⌘T | New Tab… (open panel) | Browser convention |
| ⌥⌘O | Open File… | Displaced by the palettes. The panel is also in the "+" tab-strip menu. |
| ⌘⇧L | Open Library | Bound at scene level on the Library window; the File-menu item deliberately installs no second binding. |
| ⌘W | Close Tab (falls back to window) | Browser convention |
| ⌘⇧W | Close Window | Browser convention |
| ⌘⇧T | Reopen Closed Tab | Browser convention. Pops the most recently closed tab OR window (up to 30 this run), with position, zoom, and history intact. A tab returns to the window it was closed in when possible. |

## Navigation

| Shortcut | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⌘[ / ⌘] | Back / Forward in jump history | Browser/Preview convention; toolbar buttons offer right-click history menus. |
| ← / → | Previous / Next page | Handled in `ReaderPDFView.keyDown` so it works in continuous display modes too (PDFView only paged in single-page mode). Bare arrows only — ⇧/⌘-modified arrows and text fields keep their normal behavior. |
| ↑ / ↓ | Scroll (PDFView native; pages in single-page mode) | |
| Space / ⇧Space | Scroll down / up a screen (PDFView native) | |
| ⌘G | Go to Page… | Owner request (was ⌥⌘G). ⌘G was free: find next/previous cycles with Enter/⇧Enter inside the search field. Also available in the bottom-bar page field. |
| — | Previous / Next Section | Status-bar ⇤ ⇥ buttons flanking the page arrows; also in the Go menu and command palette. Every outline entry (any depth) is a stop; pushes history (⌘[ returns). |
| ⌘O | Open Anything… — the OPEN palette | Fuzzy search over every open tab (all windows), every library book, and every collection and tag. Return opens/switches; **⌘Return opens in a background tab (palette stays up for queueing several); ⌥Return opens in a new window**. Collections/tags open every book inside as tabs. Obsidian quick-open. |
| ⌘P (or ⌘⇧O) | Go to Section… — the IN-BOOK palette | Sections (with breadcrumb paths) and bookmarks of the current book. ⌘Return opens the section as an adjacent background tab. Owner's final mapping (round 9): ⌘O = other books, ⌘P = within this book. ⌘⇧O alias keeps VS Code go-to-symbol muscle memory (key monitor). |

## Tabs

| Shortcut | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⌃Tab / ⌃⇧Tab | Next / Previous tab (wraps) | Bound by a window-scoped NSEvent monitor (SwiftUI menus can't reliably own ⌃Tab). |
| ⌘⇧] / ⌘⇧[ | Next / Previous tab (wraps) | Safari/Chrome convention. |
| ⌘1 … ⌘8, ⌘9 | Go to tab by position; ⌘9 = LAST tab | Browser convention; key monitor, not menu items. Page-layout modes moved to ⌥⌘1–4. |
| — | Duplicate Tab, Close Other Tabs | Menu, tab context menu, or command palette. |

## View

| Shortcut | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⌘B | Show/hide sidebar | VS Code/Obsidian convention (owner request; was ⌃⌘S — do not rebind ⌘B to bold, the app has no text editing). |
| ⌥⌘1 / ⌥⌘2 / ⌥⌘3 / ⌥⌘4 | Single Page / Continuous Scroll / Two Pages / Two Pages Continuous | Moved from plain ⌘digits, which now switch tabs (browser convention won). |
| ⌘\ | Split Right (toggle) | VS Code convention. No split → duplicates the active tab into a right split; any split open → closes it. |
| — | Split Left / Close Split | Menu (checkmarked by side), tab context menu, or command palette. Dragging a tab over a window's PDF area also drops into a left/right split. |
| — | Fit Width / Fit Height | Bottom bar or command palette. |
| — | Light / Dark / Sepia theme | Menu (checkmarked), bottom bar, or command palette. |

## Search

| Shortcut | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⌘F | Find in Document (opens search sidebar, focuses field) | |
| ⌘⇧F | Search All Books — library-wide full text | Opens the Library window with the search field focused, from anywhere. VS Code/Obsidian global-search convention. |
| Esc / Return | Library: clear selection / open selection | Bound locally in `LibraryView`. |

## Bookmarks

| Shortcut | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⌘D | Bookmark This Page | Browser convention. |

## Links

| Shortcut | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| — | Copy Link to Here / Copy Link to Selection | Edit menu or command palette. Copies a `pdfreader://` URL (content-hash based, survives file moves) that works from Obsidian or anywhere. Deliberately chordless — bind via keybindings.json if wanted. |

## Help & Palettes

| Shortcut | Action | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ⌘⇧P | Command Palette — fuzzy over every command | VS Code convention (its Help menu also lists "Show All Commands"). |
| / or ? | Keyboard-shortcut help overlay | Gmail/GitHub convention. Only fires when no text field is being edited, so "/" still types in search fields and palettes. Press again (or Esc) to close. |
| Esc | Close palette / help overlay | Focus returns to the PDF so arrows keep paging. |

## Palette keys (while open)

↑ / ↓ move the selection (wraps), Return runs it, Esc closes, click outside
closes. **⌘Return / ⌘-click** = open in a background tab (the palette stays
open so you can queue several); **⇧Return / ⇧-click** (or ⌥) = open in a
new window — browser convention: ⌘ = tab, ⇧ = window. Holding a modifier
shows its effect live: the selected row gets a "→ background tab"/"→ new
window" badge and the footer legend highlights the active variant. Matched
characters are highlighted; results are ranked title-match first,
breadcrumb-match second.

## User keybindings — keybindings.json

Shortcuts are user-editable via a JSON overlay applied over the default
table at launch (relaunch to apply changes). The palette, help overlay,
and menus all reflect overrides automatically because they render from
the one table.

**File**: `~/Library/Application Support/PDFReader/keybindings.json`
(strictly: `<AppDataDirectory>/keybindings.json`, so `PDFREADER_SESSION_DIR`
relocates it; `PDFREADER_KEYBINDINGS_FILE` overrides the exact path — both
for tests/automation). Run **"Preferences: Open Keybindings File"** from the
command palette (or the Help menu) to create it with a documented template
and open it.

**Format** — a JSON object mapping command id → chord string:

```json
{
  "_docs": ["keys starting with _ are ignored — JSON's comment stand-in"],
  "view.toggleSidebar": "cmd+shift+b",
  "tabs.select.1": "ctrl+1",
  "bookmarks.add": null
}
```

- A **chord** is modifiers + one key joined with `+`. Modifiers: `cmd`
  (aliases `command`, `meta`), `ctrl` (`control`), `opt` (`option`, `alt`),
  `shift` — any order, any case, spaces tolerated. Keys: single characters
  (letters, digits, `[ ] \ / ; ' , . = - + ` etc. — shifted punctuation is
  written as itself: `?`, not `shift+/`) plus `return` (`enter`), `tab`,
  `escape` (`esc`), `space`, `up`, `down`, `left`, `right`.
- A chord string **replaces ALL of the command's default chords**, aliases
  included (e.g. overriding `nav.goToSection` drops both ⌘P and ⌘⇧O).
- `null` or `""` **unbinds** the command (still runnable from the palette
  and menus, just chordless).
- Swaps and freed-chord reuse work in one file regardless of entry order.

**Validation** (never crashes on a bad file): unknown command ids,
unparseable chords, and chords already bound to another command are each
rejected individually and reported — one alert at launch plus a banner in
the "/" help overlay — while every valid entry still applies. Of two
entries claiming the same chord, the alphabetically-first command id wins.

**Limits** (by design):

- `nav.goToPage` is not rebindable and ⌘G cannot be given to anything else
  (owner ruling — see the ⌘G audit note below).
- Bare ←/→ paging is hardwired in `ReaderPDFView.keyDown`; an override on
  `nav.previousPage`/`nav.nextPage` adds a working chord but arrows keep
  paging too. Arrow keys can never be *assigned* via the overlay's monitor
  path (lists and text fields own them).
- Chords without ⌘/⌃/⌥ (like the default `/` help toggle) never fire while
  a text field is editing, so they still type.
- `file.openLibrary` is a scene-level shortcut: rebindable, but unbinding
  falls back to ⌘⇧L (a scene shortcut cannot be absent).
- Monitor-owned chords (see the audit notes) work in reader windows;
  menu-owned chords work app-wide. An override keeps its command's layer.

**Command ids** (defaults in parentheses; ids are stable API):

| Id | Command (default) |
| --- | --- |
| `file.newWindow` | New Window (`cmd+n`) |
| `file.newTab` | New Tab… (`cmd+t`) |

Implementation: `KeyChord.parse`/`chordString` (round-tripping string form),
`Keybindings` (load/parse/apply/template) in
`Sources/ReaderUI/Commands/`, overlay applied in `CommandRegistry.all`;
`KeybindingsTests` covers parsing, merge, conflicts, and unbind semantics.

## Reassignments & conflicts found in the audit (2026-07-08)

- **⌘O**: was Open File; backlog assigns it to the navigate palette. Palette
  wins (quick-open convention); Open File moved to ⌘⇧O. The ⌘O alias is
  bound by the key monitor, ⌘P by the menu item — one action, two chords,
  both listed in the table.
- **⌘P**: was the system Print menu item (the app has no print feature).
  Freed via `CommandGroup(replacing: .printItem)`. If printing is ever
  added, don't reclaim ⌘P — use the palette or another chord.
- **⌘⇧L**: bound twice conceptually (Library scene shortcut + File menu
  item). Resolved with `installsMenuShortcut: false` on the table entry so
  only the scene binding exists.
- **⌃⌘S**: was on the toolbar button; a table-driven menu item would have
  double-bound it. The toolbar button no longer installs the shortcut.
- **"/" in search fields**: the help-overlay monitor checks the window's
  first responder and never fires while any text field (including the
  palette query and page-number field) is editing.
- **Arrows**: deliberately NOT menu shortcuts — a menu binding would steal
  arrow keys from every text field in the window. Table entries carry the
  chords for documentation; `ReaderPDFView.keyDown` owns the behavior.
- **⌘G**: reassigned to Go to Page (owner request, 2026-07-08). Preview's
  ⌘G = find-next convention is intentionally dropped — find next/previous
  live on Enter/⇧Enter in the search field. Don't rebind ⌘G to find.
- **Palette split (owner request, 2026-07-08; chords finalized round 9)**:
  ⌘O = OPEN palette (tabs, books, collections, tags), ⌘P (alias ⌘⇧O) =
  IN-BOOK palette (sections, bookmarks). Open File… moved to ⌥⌘O.
- **⌘1–9 → tab switching** (owner chose tabs over layouts, 2026-07-08);
  layouts moved to ⌥⌘1–4. ⌘1–9 bound by the key monitor, not menus (nine
  menu items would be clutter); listed in the command table with
  `installsMenuShortcut: false` so the help overlay and palette show them.
- Not yet bound anywhere (future candidates): ⌘⇧G find previous,
  ⌘+/⌘−/⌘0 zoom, ⌘\\ split view, ⌘, settings (M18).
